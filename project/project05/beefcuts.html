        <h1>Popular Beef Cuts</h1>

        <h3>1. Salchi Sal (살치살) - Beef Chuck Flap Tail</h3>
        <img src="../images/8.jpg" alt="kbbq8">
        <p>Chuck Flap Tail is one of the most famous cuts in Korea. It is famous for being the fattiest meat in Korean
            BBQ. The distinctive feature of this cut is that its marbling ratio is very high. Sometimes there is more fat
            than meat. This cut should be grilled until medium.</p>
        
        <h3>2. An-Chang-Sal (안창살) - Beef Outside Skirt</h3>
        <img src="../images/9.jpg" alt="kbbq9">
        <p>Outside Skirt is one of the most expensive cuts in Korea due to its scarcity. It is famous for having a 
            beefy and flavorful taste. Due to its distinct flavor, this cut is not for everyone but it is highly 
            recommended to try. This cut should be grilled until medium-rare.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Chadol-Baegi (차돌박이) - Brisket</h3>
        <img src="../images/10.jpg" alt="kbbq10">
        <p>Brisket is also famous in Korea and sometimes small portions of the cut are served as complimentary. 
            Brisket can be very chewy so it is served in very thin slices. Because it is so thin, you only have to grill 
            couple of seconds on each side.</p>
