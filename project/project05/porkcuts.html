        <h3>1. Sam-Gyeob-Sal (삼겹살) - Pork Belly</h3>
        <img src="../images/5.jpg" alt="kbbq5">
        <p>Pork Belly is the most popular cut of pork in Korean BBQ. The distinctive feature of the cut is that it has 
            layers of fat and meat which makes it very succulent. Because it is a fatty cut, it needs to be grilled until 
            well-done. You would definitely want to choose this cut if you are a first-timer because it is easy to grill.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Hang-Jeong-Sal (항정살) - Pork Neck</h3>
        <img src="../images/6.jpg" alt="kbbq5">
        <p>Pork Neck is another fatty cut of pork in Korean BBQ. The distinctive feature of the cut is that it has 
            similar marbling of beef. Also, unlike other cuts, it has a little bit of a flaky texture. This cut is also very 
            fatty, so it needs to be grilled until well-done.</p>

        <img src="../images/7.jpg" alt="kbbq5">

            this cut is that it has both soft and chewy textures. This cut is preferred by people who dislike the fat on 
            the meat. This cut should be grilled to medium.</p>
