        <h1>Korean BBQ</h1>
        <p>You are seriously missing out if you haven't experienced Korean BBQ yet! Here is a beginner's guide to 
            ordering Korean BBQ like an expert if you are hesitant to give it a try.</p>

        <h2>What is Korean BBQ?</h2>
        <img src="../images/1.jpg" alt="kbbq1">
        <p>Korean BBQ is a famous technique in Korean cooking for grilling meat, usually pork and beef. What 
            makes Korean BBQ interesting is that the food is prepared on charcoal grills that are built into each 
            dining table. One of the advantages of having a built-in grill is that it keeps the meat warm and juicy. If 
            you are a first-timer, you are in for a treat because that first bite will blow your mind! Any meat that 
            came right out of the fire tastes the best. Another advantage of a built-in grill is that eating becomes 
            exciting. Korean BBQ is all about the experience. Grilling together and sharing adds so much fun to the 
            dining experience. If you have read this far and it is still difficult to picture what it’s like, think of it as an 
            intimate and private hibachi experience.</p>
        <p>Here are a few tips before going.</p>

        <h3>1. Do We Need to Cook for Ourselves?</h3>
        <img src="../images/2.jpg" alt="kbbq2">
        <p>Yes and no. Some restaurants will have staff to do the cooking for you, but some don’t. If they don’t 
            provide a grilling service, you can simply grill for yourself. Don’t worry, the meat is served in an ‘easy-to-
            grill’ condition. If you are struggling, you can simply ask the server and they will show you how to grill it 
            properly. </p>
        <p>P.S. - Always feel free to ask the server to change the grill when it becomes too smoky.</p>

        <h3>2. Banchan and Side Dishes</h3>
        <img src="../images/3.jpg" alt="kbbq3">
        <p>Every Korean BBQ place will have Banchan and side dishes. Banchan is a complimentary selection of 
            vegetable side dishes that mysteriously arrive right after placing an order. Yes, they are free and you can
            ask for more for free. Every restaurant serves slightly different Banchans but mostly you will find fresh 
            lettuce, Kimchi, pickled leaves, Samjang sauce, scallion salad, and seasoned bean sprouts.</p>
        <p>Unlike Banchan, side dishes will cost you money but it is highly recommended. Many people will usually 
            order a couple of side dishes with their choices of meat. The most famous side dishes are kimchi-jjigae 
            (stew), Doenjang-jjigae (stew), gyelanjjim (egg custard), naengmyeon (cold noodles), and fried rice.</p>

        <h3>3. Enjoy with Soju</h3>
        <img src="../images/4.jpg" alt="kbbq4">
        <p>As mentioned earlier, Korean BBQ is all about the experience. If you want to fully experience an 
            authentic Korean vibe, try a bottle of Soju with your friends. Soju tastes like Vodka but much lighter. It 
            goes very well with Korean BBQ because it cleanses your palate.</p>
